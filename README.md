# ðŸ’¡ IBM SkillsBuild Jupyter Notebook Project

Welcome to my **IBM SkillsBuild Jupyter Notebook Project**, where I explored the foundations of **Python**, **Machine Learning**, and the emerging concept of **Agentic AI** â€” all in a hands-on, cloud-based environment using **Jupyter Notebook**.

## ðŸ“˜ About the Project

This project is a result of my learning journey on the [IBM SkillsBuild](https://cloud.ibm.com/) platform. The notebook demonstrates core programming skills in **Python**, data manipulation using **Pandas**, and introductory machine learning techniques. It also touches upon the innovative area of **Agentic AI** â€” AI systems that can reason, plan, and act autonomously.
